      "longText": "Staying hydrated plays a critical role in pelvic health. Water helps regulate urinary function, supports tissue health, and keeps your bladder functioning optimally.\n\nInadequate hydration can lead to bladder irritation, constipation, and increased risk of urinary tract infections – all of which can impact the pelvic floor muscles negatively.\n\nAim to drink water steadily throughout the day, and adjust your intake based on your activity level, environment, and specific health needs. For most people, this means about 6–8 glasses daily.\n\nPro tip: Avoid excessive caffeine or alcohol, which can irritate the bladder and dehydrate you."
