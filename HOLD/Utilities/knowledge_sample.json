      "article": "Some everyday foods and habits can quietly drain your sexual energy without you even noticing. Processed foods packed with sugar and unhealthy fats slow down blood flow and can lead to lower testosterone levels over time. This weakens your stamina and your desire. Alcohol is another major culprit. While a small amount might relax you too much can dull your senses and make it harder to stay connected to your body. Heavy drinking also disrupts hormone balance which can reduce sexual performance over time. Too much caffeine can also backfire. While it may give a short burst of energy it can increase anxiety and tension making it harder to stay in control during intimate moments. Eating a clean balanced diet filled with real whole foods is key to maintaining strong sexual health. Cutting back on these sex drive killers will not only help you last longer but will also make you feel better every day."

To practice it set up a full body mirror where you can see yourself clearly. During solo sessions maintain eye contact with your reflection as you slowly build arousal. The goal is to watch your body and your face closely noticing every signal of rising tension without looking away. When you get close to the edge pause stimulation but do not break eye contact. Focus on slowing your breathing while staying fully present with your reflection. This forces your mind to stay aware instead of getting lost in the rush of sensation.

It also builds confidence by making you more comfortable with your own sexual energy. The Mirror Edge Technique turns awareness into your strongest weapon for lasting longer."
